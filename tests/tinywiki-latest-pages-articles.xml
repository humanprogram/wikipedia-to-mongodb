'''Toronto''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɵ|ˈ|r|ɒ|n|t|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|local|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|n|oʊ}}) is the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|most populous city]] in [[Canada]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] [[capital city|capital]] of [[Ontario]]. It is located in [[Southern Ontario]] on the northwestern shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. The [[history of Toronto]] began in the late 18th century when the [[The Crown|British Crown]] [[Toronto Purchase|purchased]] its land from the [[Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation|Mississaugas of the New Credit]].
===Before 1800===
When Europeans first arrived at the site of present-day Toronto, the vicinity was inhabited by the [[Iroquois people]].
===1800–1945===
[[File:Toronto 1894large.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Toronto, 1894]]
In 1813, as part of the [[War of 1812]], the [[Battle of York]] ended in the town's capture and plunder by US forces.

The '''Royal Cinema'''  is an [[Art Moderne]] event venue and [[movie theater|cinema]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. It was built in 1939 and owned by Miss Ray Levinsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About - theroyal.to|url=http://www.theroyal.to/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was built in 1939, it was called '''The Pylon''', with an accompanying large sign at the front of the theatre. It included a roller-skating rink at the rear of the theatre, and a dance hall on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto’s old movie theatres—the Royal Theatre (the Pylon)|url=http://tayloronhistory.com/2013/12/30/torontos-old-movie-theatresthe-royal-theatre-the-pylon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's the theatre was purchased by Rocco Mastrangelo. In the 1990s, the theatre was renamed 'the Golden Princess'.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;

Since early 2007, '''Theatre D''' has owned and operated The Royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto repertory theatre reopens with HD projection|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/toronto-repertory-theatre-reopens-with-hd-projection-1.592674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the daytime it operates as a film and television post-production studio. It hosts film festivals including the European Union Film Festival and Japanese Movie Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Place to Watch a Film in Toronto|url=http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_place_to_watch_a_film_in_toronto/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal was featured in the 2013 film [[The F Word (2013 film)|The F Word]].

It is situated south-west of [[Bodmin Moor]].

The extent of the civil parish corresponds fairly closely to that of the town so is mostly urban in character. It is bordered to the east by [[Cardinham]] parish, to the southeast by [[Lanhydrock]] parish, to the southwest and west by [[Lanivet]] parish, and to the north by [[Helland]] parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapping.cornwall.gov.uk/website/ccmap/|title=Cornwall Council online mapping|publisher=Mapping.cornwall.gov.uk|accessdate=May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050041/http://mapping.cornwall.gov.uk/website/ccmap/ |archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodmin had a population of 14,736 as of the 2011 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/data-and-research/data-by-topic/population/town-populations|title=Bodmin Population 2011|accessdate=5 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205171836/http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/data-and-research/data-by-topic/population/town-populations|archivedate=5 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formerly the [[county town]] of Cornwall until the Crown Courts moved to [[Truro]] which is also the administrative centre (before 1835 the county town was [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]). Bodmin was in the administrative [[North Cornwall]] District until local government reorganisation in 2009 abolished the District (''see also [[Politics of Cornwall|Cornwall Council]]''). The town is part of the [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]] parliamentary constituency, which is represented by [[Scott Mann (politician)|Scott Mann]] MP.

Bodmin Town Council is made up of sixteen councillors who are elected to serve a term of four years. Each year, the Council elects one of its number as Mayor to serve as the town's civic leader and to chair council meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodmin.gov.uk|title=Bodmin Council website|publisher=Bodmin.gov.uk|accessdate=May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022161430/http://www.bodmin.gov.uk/ |archivedate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Situation and origin of the name==
Bodmin lies in the east of Cornwall, south-west of [[Bodmin Moor]]. It has been suggested that the town's name comes from an archaic word in the [[Cornish language]] "bod" (meaning a dwelling; the later word is "bos") and a contraction of "menegh" (monks). The "monks' dwelling" may refer to an early monastic settlement instituted by St. Guron, which [[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] took as his site. Guron is said to have departed to [[St Goran]] on the arrival of Petroc.

The hamlets of Cooksland, [[Dunmere, Cornwall|Dunmere]] and [[Turfdown]] are in the parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorebritain.info/browse/cornwall/ |title=Cornwall; Explore Britain|publisher=Explorebritian.info|accessdate=17 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602231052/http://www.explorebritain.info/browse/cornwall/ |archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] founded a monastery in Bodmin in the 6th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Doble, G. H.]] (1965) ''The Saints of Cornwall: part 4''. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 132–166&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the town its alternative name of ''Petrockstow''. The monastery was deprived of some of its lands at the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] but at the time of [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] still held eighteen manors, including Bodmin, Padstow and Rialton.&lt;ref&gt;Thorn, C. et al. (eds.) (1979) ''Cornwall''. Chichester: Phillimore; entries 4,3-4.22&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmin is one of the oldest towns in Cornwall, and the only large Cornish settlement recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opendomesday.org/place/SX0767/bodmin/|title=Bodmin - Domesday Book|first=Anna|last=Powell-Smith|publisher=|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century the Norman church of St Petroc was largely rebuilt and stands as one of the largest churches in Cornwall (the largest after the cathedral at Truro). Also built at that time was an abbey of canons regular, now mostly ruined. For most of Bodmin's history, the [[tin]] industry was a mainstay of the economy.

The name of the town probably derives from the Cornish "Bod-meneghy", meaning "dwelling of or by the sanctuary of monks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variant spellings recorded include ''Botmenei'' in 1100, ''Bodmen'' in 1253, ''Bodman'' in 1377 and ''Bodmyn'' in 1522.&lt;ref name="sdf"/&gt; The ''Bodman'' spelling also appears in sources and maps from the 16th and 17th centuries,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} most notably in the celebrated map of Cornwall produced by [[John Speed]] but actually engraved by the Dutch cartographer [[Jodocus Hondius]] the Elder (1563–1612) in [[Amsterdam]] in 1610 (published in London by Sudbury and Humble in 1626). It is unclear whether the Bodman spelling signifies any historical or monastic connection with the equally ancient settlement of Bodman at the western end of the [[Lake Constance|Bodensee]] in the German province of [[Baden]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

An inscription on a stone built into the wall of a summer house in Lancarffe furnishes proof of a settlement in Bodmin in the early [[Middle Ages]]. It is a memorial to one "Duno[.]atus son of Me[.]cagnus" and has been dated from the 6th to 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion, photo and bibliography in Okasha, Elisabeth (1993). ''Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain''. Leicester: University Press, pp. 126-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There are no [[independent schools]] in the area.

===Primary schools===
[[Saint Petroc|St Petroc]]'s [[Voluntary Aided]] [[Church of England]] [[Primary School]], Athelstan Park, Bodmin, was given this title in September 1990 after the [[wiktionary:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of St. Petroc's [[Infant School]] and St. Petroc's Junior School. St. Petroc's is a large school with some 440 pupils between the ages of four and 11. Eight of its fourteen governors are nominated by the [[Diocese of Truro]] or the [[Parochial church council|Parochial Church Council]] of St. Petroc's, Bodmin.

There are a further three [[primary school]]s within Bodmin; Berrycoombe School in the northwest corner of the town, and [[Saint Mary|St. Mary]]'s [[Catholic school|Catholic Primary School]] and Beacon ACE Academy both situated west of the town centre. Beacon ACE Academy is part of the Atlantic Centre of Excellence Multi Academy Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-beacon-bod.cornwall.sch.uk/ Beacon ACE Academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodmin College===
[[Bodmin College]] is a large [[Comprehensive school|state comprehensive]] school for ages 11–18 on the outskirts of the town and on the edge of [[Bodmin Moor]]. Its [[headmaster]] is Mr Brett Elliott. The college is home to the nationally acclaimed "Bodmin College Jazz Orchestra", founded and run by the previous Director of Music, Adrian Evans, until 2007 and more recently, by the current Director, Ben Vincent. In 1997, Systems and Control students at Bodmin College constructed [[Roadblock (robot)|Roadblock]], a [[robot]] which entered and won the first series of [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]] and was succeeded by "[[List of Robot Wars robots#The First Wars|The Beast of Bodmin]]" (presumably named after the [[The Beast of Bodmin|phantom cat]] purported to roam [[Bodmin Moor]]). The school also has one of the largest sixth forms in the county.
